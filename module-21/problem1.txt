Answer the following questions on Separate Chaining Hash table for the keys and its hash values.
Keys : S E A R C H E X A M P L E
Hash : 2 0 0 4 4 4 0 2 0 4 3 3 0
Note: If there are no keys write null, If there are multiple keys write keys with comma space separated

For the index 0, Write the keys in ascending order.
Answer: A,E

For the index 4, Write the keys in ascending order.
Answer: C,H,M,R

For the index 1, Write the keys in ascending order.
Answer:null

For the index 2, Write the keys in ascending order.
Answer: S,X

For the index 3, Write the keys in ascending order.
Answer: L,P

After Inserting elements 1, 32, 22, 15, 33, 45, 66, 73, 10. How many collisions occur when you hashCode() as key % size after inserting keys into hashtable for given sizes below.

Size = 7 
Answer: 5 collision(1,4,1,1,5,3,3,3,3)	

Size = 8
Answer: 3 collisions(1,0,6,7,1,5,2,1,2)
	

Size = 12
Answer: 1 collision(0,8,11,3,9,9,6,1,10)
	
Size = 1
Answer: 8 collision(0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0)

In a separate-chaining hash table with M lists and N keys, the number of compares (equality tests) for search and insert is proportional to N/M. (true/false)

Answer: true

Any good hash function should have the three properties :  (true/false)

It should be deterministic, equal keys must produce the same hash value.
It should be efficient to compute.
It should uniformly distribute the keys.

Answer: true

How many empty lists do you expect to see when you insert keys 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 into a hash table with Separate Chaining Hashing with hashCode as key % size , for size = 2 without any resizing?

Answer: 0

Insert the keys E A S Y Q U T I O N in that order into an initially empty table of M = 5 lists, using separate chaining. Use the hash function 11 k % M to transform the kth letter of the alphabet into a table index.
Answer:  11 * k % M

0 - E,O,T,Y
1 - A,U
2 - Q
3 - null
4 - I,N,S
